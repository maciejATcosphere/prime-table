# Prime Multiplication Project

## Optimization

- references to the DOM objects stored in the object
- LAZY multiplication calculated on the fly
- 10k precomputed primes loaded at the beginning

## Limits


## Tests Coverage


## Future

- Add automated (selenium / robotframework) tests
- Report slow updates via ErrorView to backend for futher investigation
